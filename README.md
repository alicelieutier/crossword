Greedy python 3 crossword generator script that tries to place words from a list inside a grid.

I made this for my best friends bachelorette weekend, thus the French wedding themed words in the example.

Use your own words and run
```
python crossword.py
```
This is a greedy algorithm, with some randomness to it, so each run gives a different solution. Jsut run it until you get an interesting one.

I originally wrote this in python 3, but it seems to work in python 2.7 on my machine.
